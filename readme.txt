some comments i put for my next projects:

Imports:
import numpy as np  # numerical computations with arrays and matrices.
import pandas as pd  # data manipulation and analysis.
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression  # logistic regression, a classification algorithm
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score  # calculate the accuracy of a classification model by comparing predicted labels with testing labels
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler  # for feature scaling
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
Data collection
train_data = pd.read_csv('data/train.csv')
test1_data = pd.read_csv('data/test.csv')
Check for any missing values
print(train_data.isnull().sum())
print(test1_data.isnull().sum())
Separate features and labels:
X :train features before splitting
y :label features before splitting
X = train_data.drop(columns=['id', 'diagnosis'])  # removed id because it's not a feature and diagnosis because it's the result we want to predict
y = train_data['diagnosis'].map({'B': 0, 'M': 1}).astype(int)  # Convert to integer type
Split train_data (X y) into training and testing to know accuracy
X_train= training_data features / y_train=training_data label / X_test= testing_data features/  y_test = testin_data label
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.20, random_state=42)
Prepare test data
X_test1 = test1_data.drop(columns=['id']) #we dont need it
Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()  # create an instance of the StandardScaler class that standardizes all features into same ranges/values
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)  # fit calculates the mean and standard deviation of the values in features, then use these to standardize the features in X_train
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)  # use the same scaler to transform X_test
X_test1_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test1)  # use the same scaler to transform X_test1
How logistic regression works:
Logistic Regression finds the relationship between the input features (like radius_mean, texture_mean, etc.)
and the probability of a certain outcome (e.g., whether a tumor is benign or malignant).
The core idea is to calculate the probability that a data point belongs to a certain class (e.g., malignant),
and then classify it based on that probability.
Train our LogisticRegression model:
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=2000)  # maximum number of iterations the model is allowed to take to converge (find the best solution)
The .fit() function is what actually trains the model. It takes two arguments:
X_train_scaled: The standardized input data (features) for training the model
y_train: The target values (labels) corresponding to the input data.
During the training process, the logistic regression algorithm looks for patterns in the features
that best predict whether a tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1).
The model learns how these features relate to the labels.
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test_scaled)  # predict the result of X_test
predictions1 = model.predict(X_test1_scaled)  # predict the result of X_test1
Create a DataFrame to save the predictions
predictions1_df = pd.DataFrame({
'id': test1_data['id'],  # keep the 'id' for reference
'predicted_diagnosis': predictions1  # store predictions
})
Save predictions to a CSV file
predictions1_df.to_csv('data/predictions.csv', index=False)
Calculate and print the accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
